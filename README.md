# responsive-portfolio-landing-page-gabriel

This website was created with me in mind.
I made it the way I'd like to use it and not just for the sake of YouTube tutorials.

This website has a lot of cool stuff going on with it and it is extremely light weight.
The website has a cool Nav Menu which I made with GSAP. It has a hover distortion effect on all the images from the hero section down to the project section.
The website has animations which I made with the help of ScrollRevealJs.

To crown it all, the website has a Light and Dark Theme version so it could suit the viewers eyes if they have issues.
Your browser will remember the last theme you selected because I stored the theme selection in localStorage.

Overall, the website is just perfect for a freelancer's portfolio.
